 # ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ILOVETOMAKESTUFF
Known as I_LOVE_TO_MAKE_STUFF on Scratch

A 12-year-old Ukrainian coder who enjoys making websites and helping others out as much as I can and with as much knowledge that I have about their problem!
I dream about learning C++, but that might never happen because I'm stuck with a ChromeBook and I can't buy a Windows even if I had the money.<br>

Future mechanical engineer<br>
Loves LEGO Technic and complex systems<br>
Math nerd<br>

Pronouns: He, Him, His
